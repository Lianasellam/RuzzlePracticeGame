Follow these simple steps to get the game working on your computer:

**1. Download the ZIP File**
Click the link you were provided to download the ZIP file.
The ZIP file will likely be saved in your Downloads folder.

**2. Extract the ZIP File**
Go to your Downloads folder where you just downloaded the ZIP file.
Right-click on the ZIP file and choose Extract All (or Unzip depending on your system).
Choose where you want to extract the files, and click Extract. This will create a folder with all the game files inside.

After extracting, you'll see a new folder. Double-click on that folder to open it.
Inside this folder, you’ll see the following files:
index.html
style.css

**4. Open the Game in Your Browser**
Find the file named index.html inside the folder.
Double-click on index.html. This will open the game in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

**5. Playing the Game**
Once the game opens, you’ll see the game interface.
Here are the main parts of the game:
Enter 16 Letters: You can type your own letters for the grid here.
Set Grid: Once you’ve entered your 16 letters, click this button to set the grid.
Randomize Grid: If you want the game to pick random letters for you, click this button instead.
Enter a Word: Type a word you think you can make from the letters on the grid.
Submit Word: After typing a word, click this button to submit it and see if it's valid.
As you play, the game will check your words, and you’ll see the valid ones listed below the grid.

**6. When You’re Done**
After you're done playing, you can close the browser tab by clicking the "X" at the top right of your browser.
You can also close the folder with the game files if you're finished with it.



Bonus Tips
If you want to play again later, just follow steps 3-5 again. Double-click the index.html file, and you'll be ready to go!
You can edit the letters in the grid each time before playing. Just type 16 new letters and click "Set Grid."




In Case You Need Help
If you're having trouble opening the game or something isn't working as expected, here are a few simple things you can try:

Make sure you extracted the ZIP file correctly.
Double-check that you’re opening the index.html file, not any other file in the folder.
If the game doesn’t load, try opening the file in a different browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
